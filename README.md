# rHyperion1.x

This is a Ruby version Hyperion1.x(which is a tool bases on Python)

Supports the translation work under the command line

### There are some new features in this version

#### [1] First, rHyperion1.x is based on Ruby

rHypersion 1.x was written by Ruby 2.3.0 and some third-party gems provided by the [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/),which is 

friendly to some enthusiasts of Ruby.

#### [2] Second, rHyperion1.x has three http get engines for you to choose

There are:

1. Ruby open-uri : smallest , but slowest
2. Go net/http : Go-lang's net/http no only faster than Ruby open-uri but also has a stabler Garbage Collection mechanism than Nim. But the volume of the lib generated by Go is nearly 10 times larger than Nim's. 
3. Nim httpclient : fast http speed and small volume , but it is not stable enough to deal with a very large .srt file.

**PS:**

**Because the .so library of the Go-lang took up 7+ M space,so I compressed it as a .rar file.**

**Therefore,if you want to use the http get engine of Golang,please extract it from the .rar file at first.**

### How to use these tool?

* Download the entrie folder to your local directory

* Install the `Ruby 2.3.0 or up`

* Install the ffi gem of Ruby => `gems install ffi`

**(if you want to modify the code , you may also need the development environment of Golang an Nim-lang)**

### * In the program directory, there is a configure file name `appkey`, Input you `appid` in the first line, and the `sercetKey` in second line 

* Use the `cmd` (Windows) or `shell` (Linux) switch to the place where you put the program

* Input the command in `cmd` (Windows) or `shell` (Linux) like this:
```
$ ruby ./trans.rb YOU_SOURCE_LANGUAGE YOU_TARGET_LANGUAGE

```
